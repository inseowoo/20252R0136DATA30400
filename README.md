Final Project for Big Data Analytics: DATA304

All pre-computed embeddings and model states are stored in google drive.
- Download the zip file from this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1U9soJmWcG0Zh1lwn6IJSaDkxPoMwxxvZ/view?usp=drive_link
- Unzip the file in the main directory.

How to reproduce results:
1. Using the precomputed best_model.py
   - run the evaluate_model.py to get the submission.csv file without running the whole project pipeline.
  
2. Running the whole pipeline:
   - run the run.sh shellscript that sequentially executes each python file.
   - chmod +x run.sh
     ./run.sh
